Welcome to Expo App Starter, a template repository designed to kickstart your app building journey with Expo! This repository comes fully equipped with all the prerequisites configured for seamless development.

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
